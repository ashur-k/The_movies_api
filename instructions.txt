Step -> 1:
    Creating typescript config file.
    touch tsconfig.json

Step -> 2:
    installing typescript, type react, type node
    npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
        @types/react: 
             type React. ... Using TypeScript with React allows you to 
             develop strongly-typed components that have identifiable props 
             and state objects, which will ensure any usages of your 
             components are type checked by the compiler.
        @types/nodes:
            nodeType property is an integer that identifies what the node is. 
            It distinguishes different kind of nodes from each other, such as 
            elements , text and comments.
(imp points):
    tsconfig.json is going to stay empty but once "npm run dev" is executed
    tsconfing will get generated with with typscript settings configurations.

Step -> 3:
    starting server
    npm run dev
